<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heated Windshields Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heated Wire Windshield</li><li>Heated Coated Windshield</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Heated windshields come in two main types - Heated Wire Windshield and Heated Coated Windshield. Heated Wire Windshields have conductive wires embedded within the glass that generate heat when electricity is passed through them. On the other hand, Heated Coated Windshields have a transparent conductive coating on the glass that heats up when an electrical current is applied. Both types help prevent frost, ice, and condensation from forming on the windshield, providing better visibility in cold weather conditions.</p></p>
