<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Drilling Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normal Circulation</li><li>Reverse Circulation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rotary drilling machines are classified into two main types based on the circulation method used during drilling: normal circulation and reverse circulation. In normal circulation, drilling fluid is pumped down through the drill pipe and drill bit, and then up the annulus to the surface where it is processed and recirculated. In reverse circulation, the drilling fluid is pumped down through the drill pipe and up through the drill bit, bringing cuttings to the surface for disposal. Both types have their unique advantages and are utilized in various drilling applications.</p></p>
