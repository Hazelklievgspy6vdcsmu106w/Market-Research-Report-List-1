<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas Turbine Electrical Power Generation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT)</li><li>Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gas Turbine Electrical Power Generation market consists of two main types: Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) and Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT). OCGT plants generate power by burning fuel in a gas turbine and generating electricity through a generator. CCGT plants, on the other hand, use waste heat from the gas turbine to produce steam, which then drives a steam turbine to generate additional electricity. CCGT plants are more efficient and environmentally friendly compared to OCGT plants.</p></p>
