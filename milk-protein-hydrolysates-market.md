<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Milk Protein Hydrolysates Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Whey Protein Hydrolysates</li><li>Casein Protein Hydrolysates</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Milk protein hydrolysates are classified into two main types: whey protein hydrolysates and casein protein hydrolysates. Whey protein hydrolysates are derived from whey, a byproduct of cheese production, and are broken down into smaller peptides for easier digestion and faster absorption. Casein protein hydrolysates come from casein, a slow-digesting protein found in milk, and undergo a similar process of enzymatic hydrolysis to enhance their bioavailability. Both types of protein hydrolysates are commonly used in sports nutrition products and infant formulas.</p></p>
