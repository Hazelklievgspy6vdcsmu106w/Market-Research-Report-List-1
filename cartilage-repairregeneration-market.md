<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cartilage Repair/Regeneration Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cell-Based</li><li>Non-Cell-Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cartilage repair/regeneration market consists of cell-based and non-cell-based techniques. In cell-based methods, cells are extracted from the patient, cultured in a laboratory, and then implanted back into the damaged area to promote healing. Non-cell-based techniques involve the use of scaffolds and growth factors to stimulate the body's natural healing process. While cell-based methods may offer more targeted and effective results, non-cell-based approaches are often more cost-effective and less invasive. Both types of treatments aim to restore function and reduce pain in patients with cartilage damage.</p></p>
