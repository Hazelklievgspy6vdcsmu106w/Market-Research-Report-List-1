<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EUV Resist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Resist</li><li>Negative Resist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Positive resist and negative resist are two types of EUV resist used in the semiconductor industry for photolithography processes. Positive resist becomes more soluble when exposed to EUV light, making the exposed areas easier to remove during development. This results in a positive image being transferred onto the substrate. Conversely, negative resist becomes less soluble when exposed to EUV light, leading to the unexposed areas being removed during development. Both types of resist play an essential role in creating intricate patterns on semiconductor wafers.</p></p>
