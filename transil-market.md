<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Uni-polar Transil</li><li>Bi-polar Transil</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Transil Market Types refer to the different ways in which Transil diodes can be classified based on their electrical behavior. Uni-polar Transils are designed to protect against positive or negative voltage surges, while Bi-polar Transils can handle both positive and negative voltage spikes. Uni-polar Transils are commonly used in applications where only one polarity needs to be protected, while Bi-polar Transils are preferred for more versatile protection against both polarities of voltage transients. Both types play a crucial role in safeguarding electronic circuits from damage caused by voltage surges.</p></p>
