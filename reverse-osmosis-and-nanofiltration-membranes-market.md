<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Reverse Osmosis and Nanofiltration Membranes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Based On NF Technology</li><li>Based On RO Technology</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) membranes are two types of membrane filtration technologies used for water and wastewater treatment. NF membranes operate at a lower pressure than RO membranes and are effective at removing smaller molecules such as dissolved ions, organic compounds, and bacteria. RO membranes, on the other hand, can remove even smaller particles including viruses and salts. The market for these membranes is segmented based on the technology used, with NF membranes being preferred for certain applications where a lower pressure is desired.</p></p>
