<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Barrier Membranes in Dentistry Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Membrane</li><li>Non-absorbable Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Barrier membranes in dentistry are used to protect the bone and promote tissue regeneration during periodontal and implant procedures. There are two main types of barrier membranes: absorbable and non-absorbable. Absorbable membranes are made of materials that break down over time and are eventually absorbed by the body. Non-absorbable membranes are made of materials that do not break down and must be removed surgically. Both types play a crucial role in successful dental procedures by preventing soft tissue ingrowth and maintaining space for bone regeneration.</p></p>
