<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wireless Receivers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inductive Coupling Wireless Power Receivers</li><li>Capacitive Coupling Wireless Power Receivers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Inductive Coupling Wireless Power Receivers rely on electromagnetic fields to transfer power without the need for physical contact between the transmitter and the receiver. This technology is commonly used in applications such as wireless charging pads. Capacitive Coupling Wireless Power Receivers, on the other hand, transfer power through electric fields between the transmitter and the receiver. This method is less common than inductive coupling but is still used in some wireless power transfer applications. Both types of wireless power receivers offer convenient and efficient ways to charge devices wirelessly.</p></p>
