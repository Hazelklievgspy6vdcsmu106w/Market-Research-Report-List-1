<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Conical Twin Screw Extruder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Co-rotating</li><li>Counter-rotating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Conical twin screw extruders come in two main types: co-rotating and counter-rotating. In co-rotating extruders, both screws rotate in the same direction, allowing for efficient mixing and blending of materials. This type is commonly used for processing materials like PVC. Counter-rotating extruders have screws that rotate in opposite directions, creating a shearing effect that is useful for materials requiring high levels of shear stress, such as rubber compounds. Both types offer unique advantages and are chosen based on specific processing requirements.</p></p>
