<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydrogen Fuel Cells Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-cooled</li><li>Transport-cooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hydrogen fuel cells can be categorized into two main types based on cooling methods: air-cooled and transport-cooled. In air-cooled fuel cells, the cooling is achieved through the circulation of air within the system, making them simpler and cheaper to produce. On the other hand, transport-cooled fuel cells use a liquid coolant, such as water or glycol, to dissipate heat more effectively. This makes them suitable for applications where higher power outputs or longer operating durations are required.</p></p>
