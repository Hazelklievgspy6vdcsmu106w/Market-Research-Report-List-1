<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Highly Transparent Low Iron Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rolled Glass</li><li>Float Glass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Highly transparent low iron glass is divided into two main types - rolled glass and float glass. Rolled glass is made by pouring molten glass onto a metal table and then rolling it into a thin sheet. This process results in slight surface distortions. Float glass, on the other hand, is made by floating molten glass on a bed of molten metal, creating a perfectly smooth and uniform sheet of glass. Both types are used in various applications where clarity and transparency are essential.</p></p>
