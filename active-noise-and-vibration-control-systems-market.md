<p><strong>The Active Noise and Vibration Control Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Noise Control System</li><li>Active Vibration Control System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Active Noise Control (ANC) system is a technology that reduces or cancels out unwanted noise in a given environment by emitting a sound wave with the opposite amplitude of the original noise, resulting in noise reduction. Active Vibration Control (AVC) system, on the other hand, is a technology that minimizes vibrations or oscillations in structures or mechanical systems by generating equal and opposite vibrations, hence reducing overall vibration levels. Both ANC and AVC systems aim to provide a quieter and more comfortable environment by actively countering and mitigating noise and vibration disturbances.</p></p>
