<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ​Alkali Silica Reactivity (AS) Inhibitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>AS Inhibitors Contain Calcium Chloride</li><li>AS Inhibitors Not Contain Calcium Chloride</li></ul></p>
<p><p>AS inhibitors containing calcium chloride are commonly used in concrete to prevent alkali silica reactivity, which can cause cracking and deterioration. These inhibitors work by forming a gel-like barrier around reactive silica in the aggregate, preventing it from expanding and causing damage. On the other hand, AS inhibitors not containing calcium chloride rely on other chemical compounds to achieve the same inhibiting effect. Both types of inhibitors are important in the construction industry to ensure the durability and longevity of concrete structures.</p></p>
