<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Venipuncture Transilluminator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Infrared</li><li>Infrared Fluorescence</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Venipuncture transilluminators are used to locate veins for blood draws. There are two types of technologies used in these devices: Infrared and Infrared Fluorescence. Infrared transilluminators use infrared light to illuminate veins, making them more visible to healthcare professionals. On the other hand, Infrared Fluorescence transilluminators emit infrared light that is absorbed by a contrast agent injected into the bloodstream, causing the veins to fluoresce and become even more prominent. Both types of transilluminators help improve the success rate of venipuncture procedures.</p></p>
