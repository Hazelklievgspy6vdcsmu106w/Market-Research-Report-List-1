<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiation Shielding Blocks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Density</li><li>Low Density</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radiation shielding blocks can be classified into two main types based on their density: high density and low density blocks. High density shielding blocks are typically composed of heavy materials like lead or tungsten, which are effective at absorbing and blocking radiation. These blocks are commonly used in areas where maximum protection is required, such as in nuclear power plants or medical facilities. On the other hand, low density shielding blocks are made of lighter materials like concrete or plastic, offering a more cost-effective solution for less critical shielding needs.</p></p>
