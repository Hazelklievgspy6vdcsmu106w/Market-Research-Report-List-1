<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Brake Master Cylinder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-cylinder</li><li>Ported Tandem Cylinder</li><li>Portless Master Cylinder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive brake master cylinder market includes three main types: single-cylinder, ported tandem cylinder, and portless master cylinder. Single-cylinder systems have one chamber for both front and rear brakes. Ported tandem cylinders have separate chambers for front and rear brakes, connected by a port for equal pressure distribution. Portless master cylinders use a flexible diaphragm to separate the two chambers, eliminating the need for ports. Each type has its own advantages and is used in various applications based on performance requirements and vehicle design.</p></p>
